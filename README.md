This is my Accenture final round interview project that innovates the hyvee meat shopping experience.
Customers are able to gather an order number or a number to tell them when it is their turn to order.
Most customers have to wait in extremely long lines esspecially during holiday season.
If customers spend less time waiting they get more satisfaction, esspecially impatient guests.
Customers can also spend more time shopping for products they otherwise might not have bought if they were just waiting in a line.
